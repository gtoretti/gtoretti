Welcome to my personal repository.

I am a Java and web programmer since JDK1.1.0 (I started on Java in 1999). Before that, I had programmed for few months C++, Visual Basic, Delphi, Cobol, assembly, etc.

So I've written Java code since then.

Sometimes I take part on side-projects to meet different languages and frameworks. Then I became a programmer in some other languages as Angular, NodeJS, Python, etc.

My purpose with this repo is to keep some useful templates of projects that I have developed so far, just to make things easier when starting a new project from scratch.
